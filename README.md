[Basics of Java programming language - Java course][1]
==================

    Academic year: 2011./2012.  
    Lecturer: Dr. sc. Marko Čupić


What is "Java course"?
--------
Java course is an optional subject at [FER][2] - already for a few years under guidance of Dr. sc. Marko Čupić. It's one
of the more complex subjects because of (creative) homeworks which must be solved all in order because if you miss one - 
the very next one is an upgrade to it (and therefore you can't solve it).

What this repository contains?
--------
It contains all* solved homeworks (including their instructions inside `.PDF` format in English inside of every folder)
which are given as a task to solve at home in one week timespan.
*exception is `dz13` form package `hw2`

Homeworks were not checked at all (because of some obligations that lecturer have on other subjects) so I can't
guarantee their great performance but every single one worked according to instructions (for example Android app worked
fine, WebServer responded to given requests etc.) and I tried to use design patterns and commented code.

Why the lecture numbers and homework numbers aren't matching?
--------
Because there obviously happend some `mix` in between because some lectures don't have instructions so somewhere
lectures and homeworks start to overlap.

Who wrote this code?
--------
All homeworks and examples from lectures were personally coded except the examples from `lecture number 10` and finishing
part of `Homework 8` (statistics graph) which were written by `Mario Kostelac`. 

How can I use this?
--------
Lectures are on Croatian so there won't be much help but all homeworks are written in English so feel free to open `javadz**` where
`**` is homework ordinal number and start writing some code :)
